## Is Quotex Trading Halal?

The question of whether or not Quotex trading is halal is a complex one
that has been debated by Islamic scholars for many years.

The main issue that scholars have with Quotex trading is that it
involves the use of leverage, which is a form of borrowing money to
increase the size of your trades.

Leverage can be a useful tool for traders, but it can also lead to
significant losses if not used properly.

Another issue that scholars have with Quotex trading is that it involves
the trading of CFDs (contracts for difference), which are a type of
derivative that allows traders to bet on the price of an asset without
actually owning it.

Some scholars believe that CFD trading is a form of gambling, which is
forbidden in Islam.

## The Ruling of the Shariah Scholars

The majority of Shariah scholars believe that Quotex trading is halal if
the trader:

-   Does not use leverage
-   Does not trade CFDs
-   Only trades in assets that are halal
